A simple plugin for displaying beautiful social share buttons, no need more to power your website with this social data

== Description ==

Have you ever looked for a wordpress plugin that allows you to simply and easily add sharing buttons on your favorite social networks without having to take your head? Well, for my part I searched long and as I have not found what I wanted, I decided to build it and for that matter, share it to the WordPress community!

This plugin allows you to build your buttons (facebook, twitter, linkedin, pinterest and google plus) through a simple interface. you pick and choose :

*   the general shape (rectangle, square, round or only text)
*   then the corner shape (round or normal)
*   insert or not the icon of the social network
*   the color of the background
*   the flyover color
*   the different texts
*   adding counters (even twitter)

Of course, these buttons may appear on the pages, posts or on the home, above or after content.

In short, almost everything is configurable, it helps to have more than 400 different possibilities to create a button to your liking.

This plugin has been tested live on www.blogdecodesign.fr for a few months without any problems, otherwise it has also been tested on more than 20 wordpress themes. But as we can not quite imagine if you ever see a bug thank you to use the media on this page so I can fix it asap!
